# Python Object oriented programming

- Classes
- Python Packages
- Python Modules
- Pip
- API with requests

## The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:

### Abstraction
  - Hide away the implementation details inside something i.e a prototype, or a function 
  - When you are calling a function you don't need to know exactly what it is doing 

### Inheritance
  - Lets one object acquire the properties and method of another object
  - Allows for re-usability
    
### Encapsulation
  - Removing access to part of your code and making things private
  -  Encapsulation means that each object in your code should control its own state.
  - Example below of how to create a private varible or modules 
- Can only be called from within its own class cannot be called from external source
```python
_dob = 01/02/12
```
### Polymorphism
    - The condition of occurring in several forms.

# Differnt class names
- super
- base
- parent
- child
## Modules
Python modules are group of functions and tools that can be called by the user by using the key work import

### Lambda
- module that can be used to do maths function in one line
- any expression can be used in this function
```python
lambda Num1, Num2: Num2 + Num1
```
